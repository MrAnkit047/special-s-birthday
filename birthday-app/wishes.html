        <p>Four years ago, we started something so beautiful without even knowing how strong and special it would become. Through every laugh, every argument, every silly moment, every tear, and every dream shared… one thing has always stayed the same — my heart choosing you, every single day.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="wish-section" id="section3">
        <p>You are not just my love, you are my best friend, my comfort, my safe place, and my biggest blessing. Your smile is my favorite view, your voice is my favorite sound, and your happiness is my biggest priority. I can’t imagine my life without your presence, without your care, without your love.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="wish-section" id="section4">
        <p>On your special day today, I just want you to know how deeply grateful I am to have you in my life. Thank you for loving me, for understanding me, for staying with me, and for being you. You have made these 4 years the most beautiful chapter of my life, and I’m so excited to write every next page with you — hand in hand, heart to heart, forever and always 💞</p>
      </div>
      <div class="wish-section" id="section5">
        <p>May your birthday be as amazing and pure as your soul. May your dreams come true, your smile never fade, and your heart always stay this beautiful. And as we celebrate our 4th year together today, I promise to keep choosing you, loving you, and standing by your side through everything that life brings.</p>
